This is a project where we can use the Microsoft Azure Face API (only if you have your individual access key from the Azure site. Our project (for now) involves sending the API a photo of a human face and sending features we want to get examined. We should get details about the face in form of a json file which we can use to describe the face/person on the image we used as the input. A very simple project.
